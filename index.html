<h1 color="#555" ><strong>SHERLOCK</strong></h1>
<p>The Sherlock Holmes books, created by Arthur Conan Doyle, are some of the greatest mystery novels ever written. It has always kept us from wanting more. Edgar Allen Poe may have invented the detective story, but it was Arthur Conan Doyle who perfected it when he created the character of Sherlock Holmes.  The typical detective story begins with a protagonist who is faced with a mostly mundane incident or the report of an incident that he begins to investigate.  If we were not so accustomed to mystery novels and what makes them tick this might seem like an unimaginative way to begin a story.<br>Sherlock is a BBC series that adapts the classic Sherlock Holmes series for modern times. The three episodes of the first season received good ratings and positive feedback from critics and fans alike.
The show returned for a second season of three episodes in January, 2012.
